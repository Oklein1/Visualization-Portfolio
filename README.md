# Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my Visualization Portfolio! Here, I present a curated collection of JavaScript-based projects that aim to bring data to life through engaging visualizations. Each project showcases the versatility of JavaScript in creating informative and visually appealing representations. Explore the world of epidemics, breweries, Christmas markets, underwater museums, and even the intricacies of public transportation in New York City.


Feel free to explore each project, and don't hesitate to provide feedback or contribute to the repositories. The source code for each project is available on GitHub, accessible through the [Visualization Portfolio](https://oklein1.github.io/Visualization-Portfolio/) landing page. Thank you for visiting and enjoy your journey through the world of visualized data!
